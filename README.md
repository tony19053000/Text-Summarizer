Text Summarization
A project to summarize text using Python, deep learning, and machine learning. It uses advanced techniques like transformers and tools from Hugging Face, OpenAI, and LangChain.

Technologies Used:
Python – Main programming language for implementation.
Deep Learning & Machine Learning – Used to train models for text summarization.
Transformers – Advanced NLP models that generate summaries (e.g., BERT, T5, GPT).
Hugging Face – A platform that provides pre-trained NLP models for summarization.
OpenAI – Uses models like GPT-4 for high-quality text summarization.
LangChain – Helps in integrating multiple NLP models for better performance.
